AIMessage(content="As a vegetarian chef, 
I can help you make a delicious vegetarian version of Chicken Tikka Masala 
by replacing the chicken with a suitable alternative. In this case, you can use paneer, 
a popular Indian cheese that is firm and holds up well in curries and marinades. 
Here's how you can adapt the recipe:\n\nIngredients:
\n
- 1 lb paneer, cut into bite-sized pieces\n
- 1 cup plain yogurt\n
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice\n
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil\n
- 1 onion, finely chopped\n
- 3 cloves garlic, minced\n
- 1-inch piece of ginger, grated\n
- 1 can (14 oz) crushed tomatoes\n
- 1 tablespoon garam masala\n
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin\n
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander\n
- 1 teaspoon paprika\n
- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric\n
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (adjust to taste)\n
- Salt and pepper to taste\n- Fresh cilantro, chopped (for garnish)\n
- Cooked rice or naan bread (for serving)\n
\n
Instructions:\n
1. Follow the same marinating process as in the original recipe, but substitute the chicken with paneer cubes. 
Marinate the paneer in the yogurt, lemon juice, vegetable oil, garlic, ginger, and salt for at least 1 hour.\n
2. Instead of baking the paneer, you can pan-fry or grill it until slightly browned and cooked through.\n
3. Proceed with the recipe as directed, saut√©ing the onion, garlic, and ginger before adding the crushed tomatoes and spices.\n
4. Add the cooked paneer to the sauce and simmer to allow the flavors to meld together.\n
5. Serve the Paneer Tikka Masala over rice or with naan bread, garnished with chopped cilantro.\n

By making this simple substitution, 
you can enjoy a vegetarian version of Chicken Tikka Masala that is just as flavorful and satisfying. 
Enjoy your vegetarian Indian feast!")
